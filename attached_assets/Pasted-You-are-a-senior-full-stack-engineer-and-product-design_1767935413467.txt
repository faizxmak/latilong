You are a senior full-stack engineer and product designer.

Build a mobile-first web application that acts as an AI-powered “Travel Buddy” for travelers who want to avoid overpaying and tourist scams.

CORE PRODUCT IDEA:
The app helps travelers plan their stay in a city based on:
- Number of days
- Budget level (Low / Medium / High)
- City selection
The app recommends the best hotels within budget and advises fair transport costs to reach those hotels.
The entire experience must feel like chatting with a smart local friend.

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: React (modern hooks), Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL (simple schema)
- AI: Chat-based conversational interface (LLM-ready abstraction, mock responses allowed)
- Design: Clean, modern, WhatsApp-style chat UI

UI / UX REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT):
1. The app should open directly into a chat interface.
2. The AI should ask questions conversationally:
   - “Which city are you visiting?”
   - “How many days are you staying?”
   - “What’s your budget? (Low / Medium / High)”
3. Avoid forms as much as possible. Use chat bubbles + quick-reply buttons.
4. Each recommendation should appear as a chat card:
   - Hotel name
   - Area
   - Price per night
   - Why it fits the user’s budget
   - Fair transport cost from airport/railway
5. Tone of AI: Friendly, local, helpful — NOT robotic.

FEATURE REQUIREMENTS:
1. Budget Mapping Logic:
   - Convert Low / Medium / High into real price ranges per city.
   - Example:
     Low: budget stays
     Medium: value-for-money hotels
     High: premium but fair-priced hotels

2. Hotel Recommendation Engine:
   - Recommend 3–5 best-fit hotels
   - Prioritize safety, location, and value over luxury
   - Include short explanations like a local would give

3. Transport Cost Advisor:
   - Show fair price ranges to reach hotel from:
     - Airport
     - Railway station
   - Flag overpriced situations with warnings

4. Conversational Flow:
   - AI should remember previous messages (session-based memory)
   - Allow follow-up questions like:
     - “Is this area safe?”
     - “Can I get cheaper options?”
     - “Is this close to tourist spots?”

DATABASE SCHEMA (SIMPLE BUT SCALABLE):
- Cities
- BudgetRanges (city_id, low_min, low_max, medium_min, medium_max, high_min)
- Hotels (name, city_id, area, avg_price, safety_score, value_score)
- TransportCosts (hotel_id, from_location, min_price, max_price)

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Mobile-first layout
- Smooth animations
- Card-based recommendations inside chat
- Minimal colors, high readability
- Trust-focused UI (no ads, no clutter)

DELIVERABLES:
- Clean, well-commented code
- Logical folder structure
- Sample seed data for at least one city
- Clear separation between UI, logic, and data
- README explaining how to run and extend the project

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT build booking or payment features.
Do NOT overwhelm the UI.
Focus on trust, clarity, and simplicity.

The goal is to create a delightful, conversational travel assistant that helps users avoid overpaying and make confident decisions.
