You are a senior full-stack engineer and product UX designer.

Build a ChatGPT-quality conversational travel application with a clean, calm, and minimal interface.

APP NAME:
latiNlong – an AI travel buddy that helps users plan trips confidently without overpaying or getting scammed.

PRIMARY UX MODEL (CRITICAL – FOLLOW EXACTLY):
The app must behave like ChatGPT:

1. On initial load, show a HOME / EMPTY STATE.
2. The home state must display:
   - A centered friendly message such as:
     "Ready when you are."
   - A short subtitle:
     "Start a new chat to plan your trip."
   - A prominent “New Chat” button.
3. The chat input must be DISABLED on the home screen.
4. Only after clicking “New Chat”:
   - A new conversation is created
   - The chat screen opens
   - The input field becomes active
   - The AI sends the first greeting message
5. Do NOT auto-rename conversations.
6. Conversations should be labeled generically:
   - “Chat 1”, “Chat 2”, or timestamp-based
   - Exactly like ChatGPT’s behavior

DO NOT SKIP THIS UX BEHAVIOR.

CONVERSATION FLOW:
Once a chat starts, the AI should naturally guide the user:

AI first message example:
"Hi, I’m your travel buddy. Tell me where you’re heading and I’ll help you figure out the best stays, fair prices, and how to avoid tourist traps."

The AI should ask questions conversationally:
- Destination city
- Number of days
- Budget preference (Low / Medium / High)

Avoid forms. Avoid checklists. Avoid overwhelming the user.
